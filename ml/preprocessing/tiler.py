P3 — Sonar Processing + Geolocation | SONARIS Project
Phase 2: Sonar Enhancement + Tiling

Sonar image tiling module.

Why Tile SSS Images?
---------------------
Side-Scan Sonar images are often much larger than YOLO's native 640×640
input size. Training YOLO on full-resolution large images causes:
  - Downsampling that loses small object detail (ghost nets, mine cylinders)
  - High GPU memory usage

Tiling decomposes the full image into 640×640 patches that YOLO can consume
without internal downsampling, preserving spatial detail of small objects.

Tile Size: 640 × 640
---------------------
YOLOv8/v11 native input size. Using the same size means:
  - P1 can use tiles without resizing
  - Spatial resolution is fully preserved
  - No mismatch between training and inference tile sizes

Overlap: 64 pixels (default, 10% of 640)
------------------------------------------
Overlap ensures objects near tile boundaries appear fully in at least one
tile. Without overlap, objects cut exactly at a boundary would be invisible
to the detector in both tiles.

Edge Handling: Reflect Padding
--------------------------------
Images whose dimensions are not multiples of (tile_size - overlap) need
padding at the right/bottom edges. We use cv2.BORDER_REFLECT_101, which
mirrors the image content rather than padding with zeros. This avoids:
  - Dark artificial borders that could train the detector to ignore edges
  - Uniform-value padding that distorts normalization statistics

Output Format
-------------
tile_image() returns a list of TileInfo named tuples, each containing:
  - tile:     float32 (tile_h, tile_w) array, values [0, 1]
  - row:      row index of tile (0-based)
  - col:      col index of tile (0-based)
  - x_offset: left edge of this tile in the original image (before padding)
  - y_offset: top edge of this tile in the original image (before padding)
  - tile_h:   height of tile in pixels
  - tile_w:   width of tile in pixels

    """
    Decompose a preprocessed sonar image into overlapping tiles.

    Takes a float32 [0, 1] grayscale image (output of preprocess_image_full)
    and produces a list of overlapping tiles of size tile_h × tile_w.

    Images smaller than the requested tile size in either dimension are
    padded to fill exactly one tile. Images larger are decomposed into a
    grid of overlapping tiles, with reflect-padding at the edges.

    Args:
        image:    Preprocessed sonar image. dtype must be float32, shape
                  (H, W), values in [0.0, 1.0]. This is the output of
                  preprocess_image_full() from pipeline.py.
        tile_h:   Height of each tile in pixels. Default 640 (YOLO native).
        tile_w:   Width of each tile in pixels. Default 640 (YOLO native).
        overlap:  Number of pixels each tile overlaps with its neighbours.
                  Default 64 (10% of 640). Must be < tile_h and < tile_w.

    Returns:
        List of TileInfo named tuples, one per tile, in row-major order
        (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each tile is a float32 (tile_h, tile_w)
        array with values in [0.0, 1.0].

    Raises:
        TypeError:  If image is not a numpy.ndarray.
        ValueError: If image is empty, not float32, not 2D, or parameters
                    are invalid.

    Example:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> img = np.random.rand(800, 1200).astype(np.float32)
        >>> tiles = tile_image(img, tile_h=640, tile_w=640, overlap=64)
